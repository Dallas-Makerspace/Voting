* Admin interface for editing ballots. Note, editing should only be allowed for Future ballots.
* Pretty graphs for closed ballots.
* Mobile interface so users can vote with their smartphones.

# Low Priority:
* Ajax pagination? Sure why not.
* Recount option, because someone is bound to ask for it.
* Investigate options for cryptographically secured voting
* MySQL user database, for groups that don't use LDAP or Active Directory.
